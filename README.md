# Sales-Analytics
This project analyzes user account creation and email activity across countries. The SQL script collects and combines data from multiple sources (account info, sessions, email sent/open/visit logs) to generate a comprehensive dataset including:

Number of sent, opened, and visited emails per user segment

Account creation counts

User behavior by send interval, verification status, and subscription status

Aggregated metrics per country (total accounts, total sent emails)

Rankings of countries by activity (top 10 by accounts and email activity)

The dataset enables tracking trends, identifying key markets, and segmenting users for analysis.

Tools & Technologies: SQL (BigQuery), data aggregation, window functions, ranking, unions, and partitioned metrics.
